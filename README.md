🚀 Introducing My Full-Stack Trading Platform! 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋

I've built a full-stack trading platform using MERN technologies, where you can buy stocks, and the transactions reflect in the database in real-time! 📈

🌟 Project Highlights:

Features dummy data with interactive charts & bar graphs
Built using React Chart.js for visualizations
Uses MongoDB as the main database
Axios for API communication & CORS for cross-origin requests
Backend code: GitHub Repo
Would love your feedback! Let me know what you think. 🚀🔥
